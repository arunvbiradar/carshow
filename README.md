The project revolves around fetching and managing data related to vehicles, including makes, manufacturers, models, and specifications. It aims to provide a comprehensive web application or service offering information about various aspects of vehicles.

**Project Deployment:**
The frontend of the application is deployed using GitHub Pages, enabling easy access and sharing of the application online.

**Purpose:**
The project serves as a platform to explore and learn new features of functional components, Redux Toolkit, and TypeScript within a real-world application context.

**Frontend Technologies Used:**

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for designing responsive and custom user interfaces.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Official, opinionated toolset for efficient Redux development, including simplified state management and powerful dev tools.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making asynchronous requests to the server.
- **React Router DOM**: Library for declarative routing in React applications, with support for hash routing (HashRouter) among other routing techniques.
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosting service provided by GitHub for deploying static websites directly from GitHub repositories.

**Commands:**

- `npm create vite@latest .`: Creates a new Vite project in the current directory.
- `npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`: Installs Tailwind CSS along with its required PostCSS plugins for styling.
- `npm i react-router-dom`: Installs React Router DOM for declarative routing in React applications.
- `npm install gh-pages --save-dev`: Installs gh-pages package for deploying static websites to GitHub Pages.
- `npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux`: Installs Redux Toolkit and React Redux for efficient state management in React applications.
- `npm i axios`: Installs Axios for making HTTP requests to the server.
